# Academic-Performance-Analytics
Power BI analytics dashboard analyzing multi-year academic grade distribution, student success (ABC ≥65%), D/F/W failure trends, and the impact of TA presence on course outcomes to support data-driven academic and instructional planning.

## Problem Statement
Academic institutions require data-driven insights to evaluate student success,
identify failure patterns, and understand how instructional support such as
Teaching Assistants (TAs) impacts outcomes—especially in high-enrollment courses.

## Key Questions Answered
- How do student success rates (ABC ≥65%) trend across academic years?
- How do D/F/W failure rates change over time?
- What impact does TA presence have on course outcomes?
- How does course enrollment size correlate with success rates?
- Are high-enrollment courses more dependent on TA support?
- How do departments and faculty ranks compare on success metrics?

## Analysis Approach
- Aggregated course-level grade distributions across academic years
- Calculated success and failure metrics using DAX
- Segmented analysis by department, faculty rank, enrollment size, and TA presence
- Interactive filtering to explore trends and outliers

## Key Insights
- Courses with TA presence generally demonstrate higher success rates,
  particularly in high-enrollment sections.
- Failure rates peaked during COVID-era academic years and improved post-pandemic.
- Larger courses benefit disproportionately from instructional support.
